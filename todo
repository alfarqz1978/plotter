fix row/col swap in row by row traversal

take another stab at command writer serial/pipe choice

try introduce better piping between layers so we can do stuff like

  PngParser png/x.png | RasterDriver | Driver | SimulatedDevice | RealDevice

  cat hpgl/x.hpgl | HpglParser | Driver | SimulatedDevice | RealDevice

  PngParser png/x.png | RasterDriver | RasterDraw

  ---

  Nothing       -> PngParser            -> Picture
  Picture       -> RasterDriver         -> [HPGLCommand]
  Picture       -> RasterDraw (SE)      -> Picture
  [HPGLCommand] -> Driver               -> [Command]
  [Command]     -> SimulatedDevice (SE) -> [Command]
  [Command]     -> RealDevice           -> [Command]
  hpgl string   -> HpglParser           -> [HpglCommand]
